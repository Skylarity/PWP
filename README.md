Nitpick: Consider renaming your repository to reflect either your URL or project name.

###Milestone 3 Feedback
Awesome job on the wireframes. This layout should work really really well with Bootstrap. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier IV.
 
##Suggestions
- Take a look at the [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox) plugin for your gallery

###Milestone 4 Feedback
- I think the issue with the swipebox arrows is that they rely on some icon files that need to uploaded to your project. Take a look in the images driectory of the plugin files for icons.svg
- Awesome job - this looks great!
