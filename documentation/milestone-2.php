					</h2>

					<p>
						<strong>Name:</strong> Stew
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Age:</strong> 42
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Profession:</strong> Founder of a small start-up that wants to hire a web developer
						that's not <em>too</em> expensive, but will still do a good job.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Technology:</strong> Linux power user. He's very good with technology, but not so good
						with design.
						<small>(This guy uses an Ubuntu phone. Wow.)</small>
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Stew is constantly tinkering with his linux machines,
						so he doesn't have much time for anything extraneous like web design. Stew will spend a moderate
						amount of time looking at portfolios since he wants a good deal.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Stew needs a developer that is good at what they do,
						but still willing to receive a slightly smaller paycheck. Stew is frustrated, because the market
						is so chock-full of developers of all sorts, but most of them are not that good, or too
						expensive.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Goals:</strong> Stew's goal is to spend a reasonable amount of time finding someone who
						fits his project. He (obviously) doesn't want to spend too much time, but he is willing to put
						in a little extra effort to find someone less expensive.
